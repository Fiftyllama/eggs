# Spacestation 14 Fork

this egg is intended for those that want to host versions (forks) of wizards federation version of spacestation 14.
As spacestation 13 before, the game has a very active community that makes changes to the "original" game.
To enable this i made this egg that takes any github repo as an input (this could be dangerous, you should trust this repo).
It also requires a special made server_config.toml for all the panel variables to function propperly.
